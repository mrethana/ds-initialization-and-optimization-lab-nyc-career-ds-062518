However, note that getting regression to work with neural networks is a harder problem because the output is unbounded ($\\hat y$ can technically range from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, and the models are especially prone to **_exploding gradients_**. This issue makes a regression exercise the perfect learning case!\n",
